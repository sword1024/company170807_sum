You are tasked with writing a Java program that will calculate the sum
of values stored in a user-specified binary file. The sum must be limited
to 64-bit precision.

------[ Input Specification

The program will be provided only one argument, the path to the binary file
containing the list of integers. The binary file consists of an array of
little-endian 32-bit unsigned integers. The examples directory contains a
file "simple.txt" that contains five integers: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Malformed
input is not possible and does not need to be handled.

------[ Output Specification

The output of the program must be a single line consisting of a human-readable
base-ten form of the sum of values provided in the input. The sum may only
support 64-bit bits of precision.

    Example usage for "simple.txt":
    ,-------------------------------------,
    | shell$ ./sum ./examples/simple.txt |
    | 15                                  |
    |                                     |
    '-------------------------------------'

------[ Additional Constraints

The program must be able to handle input files consisting of more than one billion
integers. Please make an effort to make your sum program perform well for larger
inputs.
